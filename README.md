# Bookmark Reads, final project - frontend and backend!

The day has finally come to introduce my final project, an online bookshop called Bookmark Reads.
I have always wanted to have my own bookstore, so what better way than to create a virtual one combining everything that I have learnt during the Technigo Bootcamp.


## Tech

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Styled Components
4. React
5. Redux
6. A bunch of reducers, as well as persisted `localStorage`
7. Backend with MERN, `MongoDB` represent

Frontend deployed: https://bookmark-reads-by-katsiez.netlify.app/
Backend deployed: https://final-project-backend-katsiez.herokuapp.com/

Yay!
